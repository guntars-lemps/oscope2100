"Oscope 2100" is an oscilloscope software for Hantek DSO-2100 USB oscilloscope.

It is based on libusb and GTK libraries. Project does not include firmware extraction utility, you can find it in "HantekDSO" project (url http://sourceforge.net/projects/hantekdso), the utility is called "dsoextractfw"

DSO software depends on: 
- libusb (library to enable user space application programs to communicate with USB devices)
- GTKlib (GUI framework)
To successfully build a project you need to have all development packages installed (libusb-dev, libgtk2.0-dev).


Also you need to have fxload utility installed in order to be able to upload firmware in to the oscilloscope.


How to BUILD:
./configure
make
make install


How to INSTALL:

1. Download and compile dsoextractfw utility from HantekDSO project
2. Find dso21001.sys file on your DSO-2100 USB drivers CD and put it in the folder with dsoextractfw utility
3. Rename the dso21001.sys file to uppercase name DSO21001.SYS
4. Run the program dsoextractfw. It should create two files named "DSO2100_firmware.hex" and "DSO2100_loader.hex"
5. Move "DSO2100_firmware.hex" file to /usr/share/dso2100/
6. Copy the file /udev/dso2100.rules to /etc/udev/rules.d/


Now the firmware should be loaded automatically when the scope is connected to an USB port.
Once the firmware is loaded, the blue LED on the scope starts blinking.
You can now run software by typing "oscope2100" command in the console or make a shortcut on your desktop.
Make sure you have sufficient privilegies on the USB device or run as root (probably not recommended in the long run).
